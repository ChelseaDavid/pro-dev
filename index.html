			<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
			<br>
			<h3>Week 1</h3>
			<p>The main thing I have learned this week would have to be patience. Whether it be learning<br>
				data design, UI/UX, or DOM, I feel I have really started to figure out the "just breathe" moto, and<br>
				adapt to my learning styles. I have my work cut<br>
				out for me, but as long as I apply the necessary tools, and remember to breathe, I believe I be successful<br>
				at the end of this bootcamp. Though, I can now proudly say, I am familiar with basic HTML layout and format</p>
