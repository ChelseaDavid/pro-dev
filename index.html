			<h1>Team Reflections</h1>
			<p>This week(4) we were paired with our capstone groups and tasked to complete the game Forbidden Island as a team<br>
			and to note the qualities we each posses while doing so in both strength and weakness.During the game I assessed <br>
			the following about my teammates:</p>
			<h4>Marlon</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Marlon is great with strategy and being 3 moves ahead, so to speak.</li>
				<li>Marlon is also a great communicator in relaying what he believes our next move should be.</li>
				<li>Marlon was brave enough to also share his fault and that being he internalizes, much like the rest of the <br>
					 group, his thoughts or any frustrations he may have. </li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Ryan</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Ryan is very kind</li>
				<li>Throughout the game, Ryan was constantly taking other's ideas into consideration whether he agreed with <br>
				them or not. Very considerate of others feelings and opinions</li>
				<li>Ryans weakness he was kind enough to admit to the group was that he too internalizes and has a hard time<br>
				telling people no if he doesn't like something.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Caleb</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Caleb is young</li>
				<li>Caleb, though young and inexperienced, tries his best to be part of the group to the best of his ability<br>
				always throwing ideas out.</li>
				<li>Calebs weakness is he tends to just walk away from things he is not understanding and doesn't tackle the<br>
				issue head on</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Myself</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>I can't speak for my teammates, but I will say one thing I do well is try. I do my very best at all times<br>
				and try to communicate with my team if I am unsure how to proceed. I do look to others for guidance and <br>
				feel I have an excellent team that helps me accomplish that.</li>
				<li>My biggest weaknesses are not knowing how to ask for help, or letting others know that I even need help<br>
				and avoiding confrontation. I too tend to internalize and not tell others if I do not agree with something so<br>
				those will be points I will watch for during this project and have asked my team to stay in contact with me<br>
				should I get to carried away.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Stove Top</h2>
			<img src="images/stove.jpg" alt="stove">
			<h1> Potential </h1>
			<li>Yes, I have been told I have potential. I am a very self motivated being who, when given the proper
				tools and training, can accomplish any task I am presented with.</li>

			<li>Internal factors preventing me from achieving my goal would have to be I tend to worry too much about how
				and what other people are doing. So much so that at times, I can become distracted from my main goal.</li>

			<li>Some external factors preventing me from achieving my goal would have to be lack of knowledge and low social
				medial presence.</li>
			</ol>

			<h1>Value:</h1>

			<p>I try to create value for others by listening attentively, paying great attention to detail, and being the
			person who doesn’t mind doing the “dirty work” ,so to speak, or the task no one else wants to do. I am
			constantly trying to be sure I am available no matter the task. From taking out the garbage in the office to
			staying late for daunting, and monotonous tasks I am there.</p>
			<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
			<h3>Week 1</h3>
			<p>The main thing I have learned this week would have to be patience. Whether it be learning<br>
				data design, UI/UX, or DOM, I feel I have really started to figure out the "just breathe" moto, and<br>
				adapt to my learning styles. I have my work cut<br>
				out for me, but as long as I apply the necessary tools, and remember to breathe, I believe I be successful<br>
				at the end of this bootcamp. Though, I can now proudly say, I am familiar with basic HTML layout and format</p>
			<h3>Week 2</h3>
			<p>This week, for me, felt wildly more in depth than previous week. This week we were able to take a deep dive<br>
				look into methods, accessors, mutator, and state variables, along with a few mySQL commands, and constructors.<br>
				I am feeling fairly confident in the knowledge retention I have finishing out this week. Though there can be some<br>
				uncomfortable moments I am happy to say I was able to adapt and overcome while still staying on track. </p>
			<h3>Week 3</h3>
			<p>This week, so far, has been the greatest week yet for me. This week challenged me to no end in PHP and <br>
			<em>some</em> CSS, but all in all I feel i kept up well and will just need to review a bit over the weekend.<br>
				We also got the chance to submit our capstone ideas and one of my ideas was selected for capstone!<br>
				Still pretty stoked about that! Following the election for capstone ideas, we were broken into our groups <br>
				for capstone and I honestly could not be more enthusiastic about my teammates if I tried. We all seem <br>
				to work very well together thus far and all seem to have wonderful ideas for the direction we would like to<br>
				take for our capstone. <strong>TL;DR</strong> This week was a great and challenging week!</p>
			<h3>Week 4</h3>
			<p>This week has felt like a real ramp up from previous weeks. The accessor and mutators are really starting<br>
				to make sense for me. Still have some work to do fine tunning but overall feeling confident in the<br>
				understanding I am gaining is so rewarding. It really makes the hard work seem worth it rather than feeling<br>
				like i am spinning my tires in the mud getting nowhere. Also, this week has been a first for serious team development<br>
				we are starting to see the real strengths and weakness in ourselves when applied to Capstone, and doing our<br>
				best to tackle any pressing weakness as they arise while simultaneously building each other up when we can <br>
			</p>
			<h3>Week 5</h3>
			<p>This week was a lot more challenging team wise than previous weeks. My team works well together with the<br>
				exception of one particular team mate. I will not name names, but will just say the challenges of working<br>
				with other people is draining on my patience this week. The lack of personal motivation and absent mindedness<br>
				are really starting to become a problem. With a limited amount of time to complete this bootcamp, I am going<br>
				to take this weeks challenge as a learning experience for myself, rather than waste time feeling negative about it.<br>
				There will always be difficult people to work with in the workplace and this, like other things in the bootcamp,<br>
				is just another situation of practice that will allow me to further better myself in a future work environment.
			</p>
			<h3>Week 6</h3>
			<p>This week was a nice breather. I was able to get somewhat ahead with my group and our capstone project. This<br>
				week we were able to burn our first tickets and start writing our API's for each of our classes. Along with<br>
				writing our API's we were also able to begin testing of those API's through an application called Insomnia. <br>
				Testing is going well thus far and seems to be less chaotic and frustrating as unit testing. With all of that<br>
				momentum and productivity, It allowed for me to feel as though i could take a breath when I get home each night<br>
				rather than feeling like I have to rush onto the computer and shove as much information into my brain as the <br>
				night will allow. It was also extremely informational attending the One Million Cups networking event. I was<br>
				able to, with confidence, relay who I am, my goals, and purpose while simultaneously gaining potential<br>
				clients, employers, continued education and professional development. TL;DR this week was fantastically rewarding<br>
				and a boost in confidence.
			</p>
			<h3>Week 7</h3>
			<p>This week my group made some significant progress on our capstone project. We were able to burn our API<br>
				tickets and begin working on configuring Angular properly. Each week seems to be one step closer and closer to<br>
				not wondering around aimlessly in the desert of confusion. Also, George has been so helpful this week with both our<br>
				group and each of us individually. This week I also had my phase 2b (half way) check-in on my PWP. Received<br>
				some great feedback from george and was able to begin applying some of the suggestions to my page while simultaneously<br>
				correcting a few errors I was receiving when running my page through the W3C validator. I was also able to<br>
				begin preparing for our mock interviews coming up on the 31. I am very lucky to have help both in class and at home<br>
				and fully intend to take any and all inputs I am given. TL;DR Our groups capstone is really starting to come together<br>
				and PWP is coming along nicely.
			<h3>Week 8</h3>
			<p>This week was extremely stressful for me. I was out with a pinched nerve and locked body for the majority<br>
				of the week. Being stuck in bed and feeling as though I am falling behind. With the stress of interview day<br>
				approaching, I was in full blown panic trying to study as much as I could in between trying to give my body <br>
				rest. I don't do well when I feel unprepared going into any situation so missing 2 days this week really took<br>
				it's toll. That being said, my entire class, instructors included, were incredibly patient with me this week<br>
				and tried to help in any they could. This week was also interview week with both technical and HR interviews<br>
				All in all I feel both interviews went very well. I received minimal critiques and positive feedback in both<br>
				interviews. TL;DR This week sucked but I am grateful to my entire class for their help this week.<br>
