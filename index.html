		<!-- Qualitative -->
		<h2>3 Qualitative Qualities:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Punctual:</strong> always first in last out. Installers tend to get up and started between
				6 AM and 7</li>
			<li><strong>Non-Profit work:</strong> Affiliations - Wounded Warrior, Habitat for Humanity, Boys and Girls club ranch
				, Los Ranchos Boys Placement Housing</li>
			<li><strong>Flexible:</strong> able to adapt easily to my surroundings.</li>
			<li><strong>Clicker:</strong>I am very self efficient in locating answers myself. I will exhaust any and all recourse's<br>

			<!-- Balance projection -->
		<p>The dictionary defines balance as:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>1. an even distribution of weight enabling someone or something to remain upright and steady.</li>
			<li>2. a condition in which different elements are equal or in the correct proportions.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>In terms of my own life, balance is essential. When I am not at my computer, I can be found, most times, outdoors<br>
		practicing my archery skills or riding my bike along trails in my neighborhood. the indoor to outdoor balance<br>
		really helps me hit the reset button and get back to projects with a fresh set of eyes.</p>

		<p><strong>How -</strong> Through Training I hope to strengthen my coding and social skills</p>

			<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
			<br>
			<h3>Week 1</h3>
			<p>The main thing I have learned this week would have to be patience. Whether it be learning<br>
				data design, UI/UX, or DOM, I feel I have really started to figure out the "just breathe" moto, and<br>
				adapt to my learning styles. I have my work cut<br>
				out for me, but as long as I apply the necessary tools, and remember to breathe, I believe I be successful<br>
				at the end of this bootcamp. Though, I can now proudly say, I am familiar with basic HTML layout and format</p>
			<h3>Week 2</h3>
			<p>This week, for me, felt wildly more in depth than previous week. This week we were able to take a deep dive<br>
				look into methods, accessors, mutator, and state variables, along with a few mySQL commands, and constructors.<br>
				I am feeling fairly confident in the knowledge retention I have finishing out this week. Though there can be some<br>
				uncomfortable moments I am happy to say I was able to adapt and overcome while still staying on track. </p>
