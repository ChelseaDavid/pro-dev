		<h2>3 Qualitative Qualities:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Punctual:</strong> always first in last out. Installers tend to get up and started between
				6 AM and 7</li>
			<li><strong>Non-Profit work:</strong> Affiliations - Wounded Warrior, Habitat for Humanity, Boys and Girls club ranch
				, Los Ranchos Boys Placement Housing</li>
			<li><strong>Flexible:</strong> able to adapt easily to my surroundings.</li>
			<li><strong>Clicker:</strong>I am very self efficient in locating answers myself. I will exhaust any and all recourse's<br>

			<!-- Balance projection -->
		<p>The dictionary defines balance as:</p>
		<ol>
			<li> an even distribution of weight enabling someone or something to remain upright and steady.</li>
			<li> a condition in which different elements are equal or in the correct proportions.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>In terms of my own life, balance is essential. When I am not at my computer, I can be found, most times, outdoors<br>
		practicing my archery skills or riding my bike along trails in my neighborhood. the indoor to outdoor balance<br>
		really helps me hit the reset button and get back to projects with a fresh set of eyes.</p>

		<!-- What, How, Why -->

		<p	><strong>What -</strong> Develop websites & apps</p>
		<p><strong>How -</strong> Through Training I hope to strengthen my coding and social skills</p>
		<p><strong>Why -</strong>A better life financially for my family</p>

			<h1>Team Reflections</h1>
			<p>This week(4) we were paired with our capstone groups and tasked to complete the game Forbidden Island as a team<br>
			and to note the qualities we each posses while doing so in both strength and weakness.During the game I assessed <br>
			the following about my teammates:</p>
			<h4>Marlon</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Marlon is great with strategy and being 3 moves ahead, so to speak.</li>
				<li>Marlon is also a great communicator in relaying what he believes our next move should be.</li>
				<li>Marlon was brave enough to also share his fault and that being he internalizes, much like the rest of the <br>
					 group, his thoughts or any frustrations he may have. </li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Ryan</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Ryan is very kind</li>
				<li>Throughout the game, Ryan was constantly taking other's ideas into consideration whether he agreed with <br>
				them or not. Very considerate of others feelings and opinions</li>
				<li>Ryans weakness he was kind enough to admit to the group was that he too internalizes and has a hard time<br>
				telling people no if he doesn't like something.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Caleb</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Caleb is young</li>
				<li>Caleb, though young and inexperienced, tries his best to be part of the group to the best of his ability<br>
				always throwing ideas out.</li>
				<li>Calebs weakness is he tends to just walk away from things he is not understanding and doesn't tackle the<br>
				issue head on</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Myself</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>I can't speak for my teammates, but I will say one thing I do well is try. I do my very best at all times<br>
				and try to communicate with my team if I am unsure how to proceed. I do look to others for guidance and <br>
				feel I have an excellent team that helps me accomplish that.</li>
				<li>My biggest weaknesses are not knowing how to ask for help, or letting others know that I even need help<br>
				and avoiding confrontation. I too tend to internalize and not tell others if I do not agree with something so<br>
				those will be points I will watch for during this project and have asked my team to stay in contact with me<br>
				should I get to carried away.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
			<h3>Week 1</h3>
			<p>The main thing I have learned this week would have to be patience. Whether it be learning<br>
				data design, UI/UX, or DOM, I feel I have really started to figure out the "just breathe" moto, and<br>
				adapt to my learning styles. I have my work cut<br>
				out for me, but as long as I apply the necessary tools, and remember to breathe, I believe I be successful<br>
				at the end of this bootcamp. Though, I can now proudly say, I am familiar with basic HTML layout and format</p>
			<h3>Week 2</h3>
			<p>This week, for me, felt wildly more in depth than previous week. This week we were able to take a deep dive<br>
				look into methods, accessors, mutator, and state variables, along with a few mySQL commands, and constructors.<br>
				I am feeling fairly confident in the knowledge retention I have finishing out this week. Though there can be some<br>
				uncomfortable moments I am happy to say I was able to adapt and overcome while still staying on track. </p>
			<h3>Week 3</h3>
			<p>This week, so far, has been the greatest week yet for me. This week challenged me to no end in PHP and <br>
			<em>some</em> CSS, but all in all I feel i kept up well and will just need to review a bit over the weekend.<br>
				We also got the chance to submit our capstone ideas and one of my ideas was selected for capstone!<br>
				Still pretty stoked about that! Following the election for capstone ideas, we were broken into our groups <br>
				for capstone and I honestly could not be more enthusiastic about my teammates if I tried. We all seem <br>
				to work very well together thus far and all seem to have wonderful ideas for the direction we would like to<br>
				take for our capstone. <strong>TL;DR</strong> This week was a great and challenging week!</p>
			<h3>Week 4</h3>
			<p>This week has felt like a real ramp up from previous weeks. The accessor and mutators are really starting<br>
				to make sense for me. Still have some work to do fine tunning but overall feeling confident in the<br>
				understanding I am gaining is so rewarding. It really makes the hard work seem worth it rather than feeling<br>
				like i am spinning my tires in the mud getting nowhere. Also, this week has been a first for serious team development<br>
				we are starting to see the real strengths and weakness in ourselves when applied to Capstone, and doing our<br>
				best to tackle any pressing weakness as they arise while simultaneously building each other up when we can <br>
